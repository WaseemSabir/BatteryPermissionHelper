An Android Library to help navigate the user to battery optimizations settings, so they can whitelist your app. This will prevent your app getting killed in background due to Battery Optimization Managers, build by different OEMs.

## Usuage
```kotlin
private val batteryPermissionHelper = BatteryPermissionHelper.getInstance()

// check whether or not Battery Permission is Available for Device
val isBatteryPermissionAvailable = batteryPermissionHelper.isBatterySaverPermissionAvailable(context = context, onlyIfSupported = true)

// Show a dialog based on availability (Implementation left to Dev) and OnClick open permission manager
dialog.setOnClickListener {
    batteryPermissionHelper.getPermission(this, open = true, newTask = true)
}
```

To keep the library small and extendable, UI elements (dialog/popups) implementation is left up to the library user. The library will not show any screens.

Currently, the library supports following devices.

1. Xiaomi
2. Redmi
3. Poco
4. Letv [ Untested ]
5. HTC [ Untested ]
6. Huawei
7. Oppo
8. Samsung
9. ZTE [ Untested ]
10. Meizu [ Untested ]

I am open to any PR's and contributions for any devices. I'll also try to add more devices, whenever possible.
